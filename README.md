# HackUPC Rules

> ⚠️ **UPDATE**: Rules have moved, now they are in https://github.com/hackupc/legal-page

These are HackUPC competition rules, a customized version of the standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons.

There are several documents in the _HackUPC Rules_:

- [Rules](Rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Code of Conduct](CodeofConduct.md): The code of conduct any person coming to the event must follow.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](cheating_response_procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
